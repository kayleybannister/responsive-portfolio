# responsive-portfolio
this is my revised responsive portfolio, sans Bootstrap
Mobile-Responsive Portfolio Link (with CSS): https://kayleybannister.github.io/responsive-portfolio/
Bootstrap Portfolio Link: https://kayleybannister.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/ 

This was for my 2nd homework with Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp. There were 2 sections of the homework, created a mobile-responsive portfolio with HTML & CSS only and create a portfolio using only Bootstrap.
